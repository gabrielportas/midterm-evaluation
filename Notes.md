3. **Internet connection type:**

   - **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):** The router automatically obtains the IP address and other network configuration parameters from the Internet Service Provider (ISP), simplifies the setup process.

   - **Static IP:** Allows the user to manually enter the IP address, subnet mask, gateway and DNS servers, useful for networks that require specific network configurations or when using a fixed IP address.

   - **PPPoE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet):** Mainly used in DSL connections. Requires the user to enter a username and password provided by the ISP, required for some types of broadband connections.

4. **Wireless configuration screen:**

   - **SSID:** The display name of the Wi-Fi network that devices will see when searching for available networks. The SSID is the public name, while the device name is a unique identifier for the router within the local network, visible only to administrators and users of that network.

   - **Mesh network:** Wireless networks that combine a WiFi router with one or more mesh satellites to expand the coverage area of a single WiFi network.

5. **Additional services:**

   - **VPN:** Allows users to securely connect to the local network from remote locations via a VPN connection.

   - **DHCP:** Allows the router to automatically assign IP addresses to devices on the local network.

6. **Process summary screen**
